* [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* [Connected React Router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router)

This project includes usage / example:

* React-Redux - State management
* Redux-Thunk - Return functions in Redux instead of actions, ideal for orchestrating asynchronous control

* Fetch data from an API
* Caching data received from an API for configurable time
